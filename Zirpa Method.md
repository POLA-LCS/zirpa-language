# Zirpa Method

## This encrypt method is something that I like to call: "Simplihard".
- - -
It uses the whole alphabet (and some extra sounds) but in a weird way.
A, E, I, O, U.
B, D, F, L, R.
SK, GJ, KS, MN, TP.

The last row it's a new type of Letter called "Double consonant".
First of all, let's see the easy cases with it's steps:
- Hello! -> Ello! -> Elo!
- Roof -> Ruf (spanish 'U' sound).

For covenience let's call the double consonant just double and the singles ones, single.
A sigle works normally, B + A = BA.
But doubles tries to catch the nearest vowel from the first character of the double, an example:
- SK + A = SAK
- GJ + O = GOJ
- SK + R + I = SIKR (jumps over the R and writes it the last).

And of course you have Double Trouble.
MN + SK + I + E = MSIKEN

It's easier to see with parenthesis
[] + () + I + E = [(I)E]

When a double is the last letter you put an 'E' follow by the last char of the double consonant.
